# **HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout**

>## Chapter 4: Ch.4 “Links”

- To write a link in HTML you would need to use a < a> tag.

- >< a href="https://www.google.com">google< /a>
  
  + *The site link will go within the tag and the name the display name in between the greater/lesser signs*

- >< a href="name.html">name< /a>
  
  - *this will take you to a page of your own website*

- you can provide links to emails using "mailto:" and links to different parts of your page if you include "id's" in your tags.

  - this would look like < a href="#>

>## Chapter 15: “Layout”

  - When it comes to page layouts CCS can do so much in fine tuning a page.

  - using < div> will help isolate different sections in your page. Creating boxes that you can alter and play with to creat a style that suits the customer or your needs.

  - THings like *normal flow*, *relative positioning*, and *absolute positioning* can help stylize a < div> in a page.

  >## Chapter 3 “Functions, Methods, and Objects”

  - What is a function?
  
    + A function is a step by step series of statements that say " if this" "do that" kind of deal.

    + They are just like math functions or equations. You put something in and something else spits out.

  >- EX: functioin greeting( ) { document.write("Hello!");}

    - function name would be "greeting()"

    - function keyword would be: "function"

  - Variables can conflict if they do not live within a function, meaning they are in the "global scope" which means the are the same throught the code.

  - dot notation: allows you to access a property of an object.

    >- EX Let appleName = food.gala;

>## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

  - Pairning usually involves a "*Driver*" and a "*Navigator*"

    - think of this as a player and a coach

- What this means is that the "Player" is making th emoves and plays, throwing the ball and playing the game. The Coach is advising with words, often guiding to be sure the overall picture is being exicuted.

- Paired programming has the ability to help learn code through "**listening, speaking, reading, and writing.**" 

  - This helps cover 6 important steps that allow us to grow
