# **“Color”**

- In CSS there are a few ways to specify color.

   ```CSS 
   - RBG
   - Hex codes
   - Color names

- There is also RGBA. This allows you to affect `opacity`

- hsl/a - is one other way of using color but older browsers do not recognoze it

# **“Text”**

- Font-family is setup in a way that if the user doesn't have your first choice installed the browser will default to the next.

>>ex

```CSS
Body{
font-family: Georgia, Times, serif;}
```

- Font sizes can be chosen by pixes, percentages,or EMS

>>@font-face

- this allows you to use a font without the user having it on their own computer. 

There are many different attributes and ways to manipulate font in each element. From making a forn bold and changing its color, to the placement of the font on your page. CSS is a powerful tool.

```CSS
h1 {
  background - color: red;
  font-weight: bold;
  text-indent: 888px;
}
```
