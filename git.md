# Intro to Git vs. GitHub

## *Git*

    Git is like the app that allows you to add, change, create, or alter your work. If you're a musician like me, it's a DAW system like Protool or Logic X that gives you the ability to create music.
## *GitHub*
    GitHub is like Dropbox but on steroids. The Hub allows you to save your current project in the cloud. You or anyone working on your project then can tap into that and see/work on your project.
