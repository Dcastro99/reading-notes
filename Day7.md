* *programing is basically cfeating formulas that will output commands.* 

>### *examples are*

**Assignment	x = y	x = y**

**Addition assignment	x += y	x = x + y**

**Subtraction assignment	x -= y	x = x - y**

*Multiplication assignment	x *= y	x = x * y**

**Division assignment	x /= y	x = x / y**


* JavaScript allows functions to be used over and over again cutting down the CPU usage as well.
