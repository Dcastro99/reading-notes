# **React and Forms**

> ## React Docs - Forms

1. What is a ‘Controlled Component’?

- An input form element whose value is controlled by React

2. Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.

- As soon as they type.  It runs on every keystroke to update React state.

3. How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?

- we target the value of whats being submitted.

> ## THe Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained

1. Why would we use a ternary operator?

- when using it instead of an (***if***) Statement.

2. Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:

```javascript
if(x===y){
  console.log(true);
} else {
  console.log(false);
}
```

```javascript
x===y ? 'true' : 'false';
```
