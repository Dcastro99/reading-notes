# **Functional Programming**

> ## Functional Programming Concepts

1. What is functional programming?

- Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data — Wikipedia
`pure function`


2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

+ returns the same result if given the same arguments

3. What are the benefits of a pure function?

- easy to test

4. What is immutability?

+ Unchanging over time or unable to be changed.


5. What is Referential transparency?

-  if a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent.

What is a module?

- another javascript file

What does the word ‘require’ do?

- it allows us to globally grab the module and pass it to another module

How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?

```js
require ('./(module name)')
```
What do we have to do to make a module available?

```
module.exports = (module function);
```
