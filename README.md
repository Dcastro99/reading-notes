## Growth Midset

> Growth mindset comes down to positive thinking in my book.  Remaining positive in every situation can be challenging but maintining that top of mind will help anyone break through daily challenges that they may be facing. Positive mind, positive outcome.


### Ways to keep myself in a Growth Mindset
  - Ask myself " in which way am I responding to the current situation"
  - Understand that "Just because I don't know, doesn't mean I can't figure it out."
  - Remind myself to view challenges as an opportunity to learn and growm, not to give up.
