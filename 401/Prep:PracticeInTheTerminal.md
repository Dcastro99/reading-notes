# **Practice in the Terminal**

> ## The Command Line

- What is it ?

-- Text based interface to the system

- how does it work ?

-- You can navigate to files through the terminal.

- How do I get to one ?

-- If you have a Mac like I do, it's already installed :)

> ## Basic Navigation

- PWD: Print Working Directory (this is where one currently is).

- ls: List the contents within the current directory.

- cd: Change Directories

> ## More About Files

- When naming our files it is important not to have any spaces as the terminal reads this as a seperate file.

> ## Manual Pages

- the terminal is a powerful tool. Looking up manual pages can be achieved by inputting 
```HTML
-> ~ man ls
-> ~ man -k
```

> ## File Manipulation

Some of the basic navigation inputs to add or copy files inot the terminal are as follows:

```
 > mkdir
Make Directory - ie. Create a directory.

 >rmdir
Remove Directory - ie. Delete a directory.

 >touch
Create a blank file.

 >cp
Copy - ie. Copy a file or directory.

 >mv
Move - ie. Move a file or directory (can also be used to rename).

 >rm

```
