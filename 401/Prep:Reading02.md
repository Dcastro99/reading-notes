# **The Growth Mindset**
I am revisiting this topic once again and find myself taking new notes on the topic.  A growth mindset to be seems to boil down to positivity.  Keeping a positive mind or outlook on life, work, love, etc. will always help you grow and challenge you in most cases.

I loke Angela Lee Ducworth's TED Talk on "grit" which I believe is taught at home. Understanding a child and the way they learn and what the need to become successful is a learned skill and best if learned from an early age by their parents. This of course can be learned at any point in ones life as so many examples have proven. 

Finally aI also like the repetition approach. Alan Watt's once said "After all, if you do really like what you're doing, it doesn't matter what it is, you could eventually become a master of it." That is repetition helps hone on a craft.
