# **Context API - Behaviors**

> ## Hooks and Context example

1. With regard to the React Context API, what does a “provider” do?

- Provider allows information from context to be passed through it.

2. With regard to the React Context API, how would we implement a “consumer” role?

- I believe once a user signs in we can pass user information through context API to pages that need it.

3. Specifically with Context, how are we “wrapping” components to achieve our goals?

- WE are wrapping them from the root level.

1. Consume content from (at least) two more of the Awesome React Context links. After some familiarity with React Context, once again share your takeaways from each:

   1. Takeaway 1: use new react context api = seems very simple but I know it's not. I love that we're able to passing information around eaily.

   2. Takeaway 2: What's new in React = Context API! Great breakdown on how to simply use it and try it out. Passing objects or passing props it make it easier to get the job done. With caution of overuse of course.
