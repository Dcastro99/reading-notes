- Trees, in this case, `binary trees` are nodes that either have a left or a right node that are children of the root node and then those children can have children and be also roots. 

- trees have `depths` and that means from roo to furthest extention of a layer. In the example above the `depth` is 4.

- to traverse through the tree we consider the depth. The methods we use to traverse are as follows:

```javascript
pre-order /* Root >> Left >> Right*/
in-order /* Left >> Root >> Right*/
post-order /* Left >> Right >> Root*/
```
