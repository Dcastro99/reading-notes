# **Ethics in Tech**

> ## Ethics in the workplace

- Wow... a powerful messege the auther takes on the weight and importance one has in what we sign up for to code. For a young girl to take her life because of a drug prescribed on a test the author wrote for a company is a very sad outcome. I can see how this helps me ask the question, what are we building and how does this affect everyone.

> ## Ethics in Technology

- I love this idea of self driving cars and hav thought about these tough questions. What does the car decidein a no-win situation. No different than having a brand new teenager driving and them not sure af themseleves can make the road a very dangerous place. But in this case I believe control is an allusion. Even if we had the ability to choose, the outcome would devistate someone or someones family. Not easy choices to make but I stand behind progress in tech. I just hope we find a happy place in it all.
