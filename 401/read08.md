# **Access Control (ACL)**


> ## 5 Steps to RBAC

1. What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and why do we care?

- The idea of assigning system access to users based on their role within an organization. Because it's much easier to audit user rights, and to correct any issues identified.

2. Describe a Role/Permission heirarchy that you might implement using RBAC.

- In a warehouse setting, I'd give the supervisor full access to add / delete / update the inventory but restrict personal emoployee documnetation manipulation. HR would have the ability for administrative roles but would be restricted to the roles and rights of a supervisor. Also a warehouse employee will have access you view the inventory in the system but not able to manipulate it.

3. What approach might you take to implement RBAC?

- I would first assess what needs the company has and what roles need to be implemented, From there I would establish what abilities these roles will have.

1. If Authentication is “you are who you say you are,” what is Authorization?

- A check system that verifies that process and grants access

2. Name three primary rules defined for RBAC.
```
  1. Role assignment
  2. Role authorization
  3. permission authorization
```
3. Describe RBAC to a non-technical friend.

- organizing the structure of a company into roles and responsibilites.  Like a house with roomates. Weekly task lists are assigned and responsibilities are given. Not everyone has the ability to pay the utilities but everyone can view the bills. something like that.
