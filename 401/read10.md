# **Stacks and Queues**

I really love this example below. It illustrates an stacked node list. This helps further understand what is happening in each step of the satcked list.

For example:

`FILO` is "First in last out" which means the fist node into the stacked list wil be the last to get out or "pop" out.

In turn `LIFO` is "Last in first out" which is basically that, the last node to be added will be the firs to go.

What helps me understand this is the way each node points to the next until the first node points to "NULL". It was hard for me to grasp this in the lessons but looking at this cleared it right up.
