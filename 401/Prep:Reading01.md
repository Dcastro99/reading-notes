1. What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

- I believe in my recent industry I've developed strong skills in problem solving and team building. Networking or team work is a major part of any successful project, company, business. Customer service is also a strong suit that I believe plays a large role in any industy, be it internal customer service or external it is very important to display and carry out.

2. What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

- I believe, based on what I read, that I would like to use "thinking lik a programmer" more often. Also to keep "time is money" in the forefront. Lastely sticking to the 15 minute rule of asking for help will be just as imoprtant.
