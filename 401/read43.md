# **OSS Contributions**

I can see how open contibutions can play a big role in developing ones skills. This puts you with like minded people working together on a goal. People in the industry that may or may not have more experience than you in the feild. Finding my first contribution will be scary I'm sure. Not knowing the vocabulary or whats expected but it'll get me a little more comfortable in the environment.

Staying in one open source code for a long period of time can rob you of exploring others and gaining that knowlegde. Excited to see what this looks like in the real world.
