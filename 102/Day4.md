## Day 4
- ### *wireframe*

Wireframe is the bare bones approach.  Think of it as a rough draft/sketch.  Before we begin to punch away at code, we need to begin with a simple sketch idea of what the customer/you want to bring to life.  There are 6 steps to keep in mind.

>### 6 Steps
1. Do your research
2. Prepare your research for reference
3. Make sure you have your user flow mapped out
4. Draft, don’t draw. Sketch, don’t illustrate
5. Add some detail and get testing
6. Start turning your wireframes into prototypes

- ### *HTML*

HTML is like creating the blueprints of a home.  How many rooms, kitchen, bathroom, living room, etc. Simply putting down everything that we wantin our website without bells and whislte.

- ### *Semantics*

Semantics is the meaning of the peice of code. For example <H 1> means the most important thing on a page. Like a title for example.
