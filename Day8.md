# Day 8
>## Operators and Loops

- *Loops in JavaScript is exactly what it sounds like.  Creating something that'll loop over and over again, all depending  on the function created for the loop.*

### Example

>> **For example, the idea "Go five steps to the east" could be expressed this way as a loop:**

- for (let step = 0; step < 5; step++) {
  // Runs 5 times, with values of step 0 through 4.
  console.log('Walking east one step');
}

( Another example would be a loop that has a limit amount of times you can guess an answer and track that infromation. )
