> ## Ch. 16 - “Images”

- You can use HTMl or CSS to control the size of an image. in an HTML it'll look something like this

```html
<img src="images/photo-meduim" width = 300 heigth = 175 alt = "cool-photo">

In CSS it'll look something like this:
```

```css

 /* call the tag like */
.headerPic{
  width: 300px;
  heith:175px;
}
```

- You can also do things like add backgorund pictures to you page and have text or whatever else display on top of that pictire. see below

- you can play with this as well by using css to manipulate the picture in many ways.

> ## Ch. 19 - “Practical Information” 

- SEO or System Engine Optimization has a few key points to follow.
  - as you develope your page you should think about what people will type in a search engine and including that in your page so it  comes to the top when searched.
  - another is using key works in your HTML that will help the search engines know that those topics are covered in your page. Be sure to include the right text on your images as they can help too.
  - Also very important that other pages are linked into yours. Example is if you have an instrument page, then search engines look at what other music instrument or like topic pages are linked up to know your relevance.

* learning about your visitors or customers is also just as important. Finding out how they found you and what they're looking for is called ***Analytics.***
