# **CSS Layout**

> ## Ch. 15 - “Layout”

- With CSS you are able to take a better control of you page. This in my opinion, is the funnest part of coding. You are able to full get creative in the ;ayout and expression of the page and in most cases you will be expressing what the customer is requesting.

- an example of this can be using "float" prpoerty 

```CSS
p{
  float: left;
  width: 20px;
  font-size: 50%;
  color: red;
  padding: 3px;
}
```

> - this shows you how to float a paragraph to the left of the screen and changed a few properties ther within.

> Fixed layout vs fluid or liquid layout.

- a fixed layout will allow the developer a little more control on how the layout is percieved as the page stays the same no matter the size of screen.

- a liquid layout can move and adjust to the page size

- both have ther advantages and disadvantages

> Layout Grids

- 960 pixel grid:
  
  - an example would be a 12 column grid

  - This would have 10 pixels between the colunms each if the columns were set to 60px.

  - you can orginize a page to have the appearance of a very clean balanced layout. 

  - you can have boxes line up to tyhe columns in groups, again lining up and looking sleek.

- Another great tool is having the abilitly to use mulitple style sheets.

- This can allow the developer to use various types such as tables and forms as an example.
