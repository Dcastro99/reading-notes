# **CSS Layout**

> ## Ch. 15 - “Layout”

- With CSS you are able to take a better control of you page. This in my opinion, is the funnest part of coding. You are able to full get creative in the ;ayout and expression of the page and in most cases you will be expressing what the customer is requesting.

- an example of this can be using "float" prpoerty 

```CSS
p{
  float: left;
  width: 20px;
  font-size: 50%;
  color: red;
  padding: 3px;
}
```

> - this shows you how to float a paragraph to the left of the screen and changed a few properties ther within.
