## Growth Mindset

>### *Ways to keep myself in a Growth Mindset*
  - Ask myself " in which way am I responding to the current situation"
  - Understand that "Just because I don't know, doesn't mean I can't figure it out."
  - Remind myself to view challenges as an opportunity to learn and growm, not to give up.
