### Structure

- HTML  is the wireframe of a basic webpage.  Look at it as the blueprint of a building. This allows you to layout a page in a proper format and choose what text information will go where. HTML pages are text documents providing the information desired.

- HTML works by using things call tags.  An opening tag
and a closing tag as found in a studdy book

### Extra Markup

- In this chapter we covered DOCTYPES which tell the web browser which HTML you are using.  There are about 4-5 different types that will vary in functions.

- You can add notes within your code in HTML by using

> <! *example of comment here...* >

and this can store informaation regarding why or reasin a certain code was used or stating the end a a section for example.

- Also covered attributes.  Certain attributes will play a specific role in CSS and help identify particular elements.

### HTML5 Layout

- HTML5 allows you to break or separate things on your page a little cleaner by using new elements. Example is, instead of using < DIV > to group things together you can use < ARTICLE > and < ASIDE > instead.

- If you are running into an older browser like explore 8 you will need to use CCS to tell it which are block elements.

- New fun tool < HGROUP > will allow you to group H-Level headers 1-6 and be treated as one Header.

### Process & Design

- this chapter is what this class is all about. the customer. When creating a website you need to understand the basics before starting. What does the customer want or what do you want your audiance to see, or how would you like them to be engaged?

  - Creating a task list of processes will be very important.

  - Site map - what page will lead to what other page. Overall structure of the website.

  - Wireframe - this will be the sketch of each page and organizing them.

- These will be the main processes to tackle on before getting started on code.

- After this you'll need to ask questions like Design, visual asthetics, what will keep bringing the customer back?
