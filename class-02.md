### Headings & Paragraphs

- There are 6 sizes of headings lable as < H1> through < H6> and they will appearform largest to smallest.
- to build paragraphs we place them in < p> and < /p> the actual paragraph will live within these tags

### Bold, italic, & emphasis

- To bold a word or statement you can place them between < b> and < /b> tags

- For words to appear italic we place them in < i> and < /i>

- < br /> allows you to break lines inside a paragraph

- < hr /> creates a line that'll separate two lines

- < em> makes a word stand out which usually looks italic
